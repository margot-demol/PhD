# Description

## Download to raw files 
Raw files should gather all data from one type+source kind of drifters : 
- file name : type_source_datemax_heuremax.csv
- common variables name : id, time, lon, lat
- time in timestamp type
- index = id

(see csv_raw_files.ipynb)

## Identifying start-end time and position, + end_reason and store it in yaml
- Identify time value before deployment and after landing or boat recovery
- double check start end time

### L1
- Retrieve value before deployment and after landing or boat recovery
- select GPSQuality==3 for carthe
- remove extreme outliers outside the mediterranean sea (0<lon<12, 36<lat<45)
- remove nearby time situation (identified in carthe) with 1/2 période classique
- compute dt, velocities and accelerations

(see csv_L1_files.ipynb)
