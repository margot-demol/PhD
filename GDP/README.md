### zarr_synthetic_trajectories.ipynb
We generate synthetic exponentially autocorrelated velocity timeseries.\\
Displacement and acceleration timeseries are derived.\\

We verify pure exponentially decorrelated timeseries are not differentiable and lead to white noise acceleration.\\
A modification leading to differentiable solutions is used and consists in (multi-layer) embeded Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) processes [Sawford 1991, Viggiano et al. 2020].
All processes are assumed Gaussian and could be extended to more general distributions [Viggiano et al. 2020].\\
